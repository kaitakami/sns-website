## How I got the job

Being 18 and trying to find a job as a developer <b>is hard</b>. It's no easy work and I had to try and fail many times before getting a job. Just build stuff and eventually, if you build valuable software, someone will try to hire you. Try to participate in as many activities as possible. Participate in hackathons, jams, collaborate with other devs, create content, share stuff you learn...

In my case I <b>hit the jackpot</b> when I applied to [Makers Fellowship](https://www.makers.build/). I didn't care a lot about the quality of others' projects.I just did what I know best, which is building web applications with the [T3 stack](https://create.t3.gg/), while also taking risks to stand out from the "competition".

I'll dive deeper into my Makers application when MF-4 is near. For now, you can see my [coding project loom video here](https://www.loom.com/share/3e18f1060acd4998bff789681d177569).

Through the fellowship, I landed a job after one application and three interviews. Just like that, I became a full-time software engineer. Unexpectedly, my role required English proficiency, which was initially daunting. However, embracing challenges has been my mantra. This mentality helped me accept the role, even with reservations about my communication skills. I was Domu's first hire. It felt surreal. Despite having no prior experience in a formal dev role, but I was ready for any challenge.

## First week

The first week was, to put it mildly, intense. I felt overwhelmed, unproductive, and somewhat isolated. I was the lone tech person in a startup world dominated by sales.

That week will forever be remembered as the "what was I thinking?" week. I felt out of my depth with the tasks I was assigned. I considered myself a full-stack dev who loved frontend, but at Domu, it was all about APIs and backend. But I made it through that week, and it changed my mindset. It made me realize that with dedication and time, I can achieve anything. As Brian Eich once said, <b>"Impossible just takes longer"</b>. And I think this is always going to be key. Committing yourself to do stuff you don't know is scary, but it's better to ask for forgiveness than for permission. So, when an opportunity shows up, grab it and don't let it go.

## Second week

I would say this second week was, so far, the most productive week I've ever had in terms of GitHub contributions. It was a great week, and we launched our first demo. I've made two big mistakes in my career so far (that I've realized):

1. Thinking that my stuff won't be used in the future because it's a demo or because the startup is just starting out.
2. Architecture and infrastructure are always important.

No one knows if your stuff will be used in the future, and that's why you should code it to be future-proof (for at least the next 6 months). However, you've got to manage your time, especially in a startup. Defining what is high-priority is crucial to not fail.

My rule is, if I'm not certain that this will go to production, I won't spend much time thinking about the infrastructure or architecture. Something that I try to do is use tools like [eraser.io](https://eraser.io) or [excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com) to organize myself. to organize myself. For me, this is enough to start coding. However, I always find the solution before the implementation. Think about BUD (bottlenecks, unnecessary code, and duplicated code) and find the perfect balance between planning/implementation. It's easier said than done.

By the end of the second week, another dev [@santi](https://github.com/blvckcenturion) joined us, and I wasn't alone anymore. Having someone to collaborate with made a world of difference.

## Third week and fourth week

The biggest lesson, besides tech stuff, was learning to avoid micromanagement.

If you're constantly being directed, something's off. Sure, devs need to know where the business is heading, but it's essential to recognize what benefits the company most. I'm still WIP, but keeping this in mind has sharpened my approach. My current strategy is to go ahead and do what I think is better for the business.

During the third week, firefighting metaphors best describe my role. Our team faced challenges deploying our API instances, demanding immediate troubleshooting. It was an authentic startup experience.

I'm proud I stuck with it.

## Conclusion

Big thanks to Cami, Nico, and Santi for always having my back in this journey.

Lastly, Mitsu, you always know how to push my boundaries, and I'm all in for it.
