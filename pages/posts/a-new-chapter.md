The moment I found out I got the job, I was stunned. I had been on the hunt for a developer position for over six months, and at last, thanks to the Makers Fellowship, I had succeeded.

Let's backtrack to when I decided to join the Makers Fellowship. I was familiar with Makers, but I thought it was only for founders. Even though I have aspirations to become a founder someday, my immediate goal was to land a dev job. I had no idea they offered a coder fellowship.

With the fellowship, I managed to secure a job after one application, three interviews, and one contract. Just like that, I was a dev. And the best part? The founders of the startup that hired me were people I deeply respected. I felt like I had won the lottery and was eager to start my journey with this company. Being the first employee of a company, with no prior dev work experience, was a bit intimidating, but I was ready for any challenge that would make me grow.

The first week was, to put it mildly, intense. I felt overwhelmed, unproductive, and somewhat isolated. I was the lone tech person in a startup world dominated by sales. That week will forever be remembered as the "what was I thinking?" week. I felt out of my depth with the tasks I was assigned. I considered myself a full-stack dev who loved frontend, but in an AI startup, it was all about APIs and backend. But I made it through that week, and it changed my mindset. It made me realize that with dedication and time, I can achieve anything. As Brian Eich once said, "Impossible just takes longer".

The second week was a significant improvement. Another dev joined the team, and I was no longer alone. It might sound strange, but having someone to compare my progress with gave me a lot of confidence in what I was doing.

I'm incredibly grateful to Cami, Nico, and the Makers Team for giving me this opportunity and believing in my potential. I'm committed to always giving my best, no matter what. Whatever happens, I'll keep pushing forward, learning, and sharing my knowledge along the way. This journey has been truly amazing.
